# mycookbook-public
Mycookbook is a Progressive Web App (PWA), made with the Ionic and Angular Framework as a project for my Associate Degree. You can create and organize personal recipes. You can also call the Spoonacular API to search for recipes online. More information about this in the README file.

==FOR DEVELOPERS==
To make the API work, first acquire your API key from Spoonacular by creating an account.
Afterwards, edit the environment files in src/ and paste your API key in the spoonacular key field.
